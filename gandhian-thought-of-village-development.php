                                    <p>Gandhian village development thinking is based on the belief that rural
                                        communities are the foundation of a healthy society. According to Gandhi, the
                                        village is a self-sufficient unit capable of meeting its inhabitants' basic
                                        needs through local resources and community cooperation. He advocated for the
                                        transfer of power and resources from urban areas to villages, promoting a model
                                        of sustainable and equitable development that would ensure the well-being of all
                                        members of society. Gandhi believed that rural development should be based on
                                        nonviolence, self-reliance, and respect for nature, emphasizing the importance
                                        of agriculture, handicrafts, and other traditional practices as a source of
                                        income. His vision of village development centered on empowering local
                                        communities to take control of their own fates, fostering a sense of collective
                                        responsibility and cooperation that would aid in the construction of a stronger,
                                        more resilient society.
